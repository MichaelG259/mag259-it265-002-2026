#### Goals for this Module
- [x] Complete Atari Review
- [x] Continue Brainstorming for Project

#### Progress
- **What I accomplished**:
  - I played Dig Dug for the first time.
  - I researched Dig Dug history.
  - I reviewed Dig Dug for the assignment.
- **Challenges faced**:
  - AI clogged up search queries during research, had to dig for human-driven content.
- **Solutions**:
  - Spent more time than necessary on this assignment.

#### Free Thinking
- Considered a possible design for the project.
-   I was inspired by the concept of a "Post-Apocalyptic Artillery Experience", and iterated on that idea until I came up with one I believe could work.
      A turn based asymetrical board game. The field consists of a grid with two sides. One line at the end of the grid is owned by the "defending" player, while the rest of the board belongs to the attacker. The defender, on his turn, can place an impassable tile on the board, or, move a defending piece which allows the defender to see down the length of the board for only that column. If one of the attackers pieces is in the line of sight, it is destroyed. On the attackers turn, he may move all of his pieces by one tile. If one piece reaches the defenders side, the attacker wins. The defender wins if all pieces are destroyed. The attacker can see the entire board, but the defender cannot see the attackers pieces.
