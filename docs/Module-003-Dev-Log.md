#### Goals for this Module
- [x] Complete Case Study 2
- [ ] Continue brainstorming for physical project

#### Progress
- **What I accomplished**:
  - I completed the second case study.
  - I played a physical board game in class to get ideas for my own project.
- **Challenges faced**:
  - I realized that my previous idea was potentially extremely unbalanced, as well as generally unfit for a physical medium.
- **Solutions**:
  - I have begun to think seriously about alternatives for my game project.

#### Learnings
- I learned what a simple card / board oriented project looks and plays like, which has given me some ideas of my own.

#### Free Thinking
- A card game could potentially be very complex with little effort, and a lot of planning, which would be ideal for my personal development style.
- A board game may better lend itself to my skills, but would require more refined preplanning.

#### Next Steps
- Tasks or experiments to focus on during the next session.
