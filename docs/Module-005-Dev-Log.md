#### Goals for this Module
- [X] Complete Working Prototype
- [X] Commence Playtesting
- [ ] Begin production of physical prototype

#### Progress
- **What I accomplished**:
  - Game was brought to a playable state, and three sessions were played. Advice was given, processed, and implemented.
- **Challenges faced**:
  - Lack of funds, materials, and time necessitated the first playable prototype be a digital recreation. Physical pieces pending assembly.
- **Solutions**:
  - Physical prototype will be procrastinated until the last minute.

#### Learnings
- It is difficult to balance alone, third party suggestions are very important to prevent oneself from getting lost in their own mind.

#### Free Thinking
- Physical board could be constructed out of cardboard, with taped or glued printed paper for the background.

#### Next Steps
- Begin seriously thinking about how the physical product will look.
