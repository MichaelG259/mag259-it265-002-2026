#### Goals for this Module
- [x] Complete Brainstorm document

#### Progress
- **What I accomplished**:
  - Summarize completed tasks or progress made.
  - I completed the brainstorming document using the template provided.
- **Challenges faced**:
  - Describe blockers, bugs, or issues encountered.
  - Coming up with a studio name was exceptionally difficult, and I am not necessarily happy with any of the names.
- **Solutions**:
  - Detail how you addressed challenges or your thought process.
  - I recognized that this is just a class and I can always change the name later if I desired. I also remembered the saying that "there is nothing more permanent than a temporary solution", so I came up with a name I thought was decent and moved on.

#### Learnings
- Key insights, techniques, or concepts explored.
- Thought seriously for the first time about the genre/direction I would be heading in when creating games for this class.

#### Free Thinking
- Brainstorm or reflect on design ideas, architecture patterns, or potential improvements.
