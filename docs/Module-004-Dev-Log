#### Goals for this Module
- [x] Continue brainstorming for Game Design Project
- [x] Complete Color Theory Case Study
- [ ] Begin designing physical prototype

#### Progress
- **What I accomplished**:
  - I believe that I have brainstormed enough for my game design project to begin constructing a physical prototype.
  - I completed and submitted the case study.
- **Challenges faced**:
  - Dig Dug does not lend itself well to UI redesigns, given it only has four stats to track.
- **Solutions**:
  - Game design was brainstormed with family to generate new and unique ideas.
  - Case study was improvised.

#### Learnings
- Designing a physical game can still be fun, despite being outside of my usual skill sets.

#### Free Thinking
- Game is tile based.
- Game consists of two sides, Attacker and Defender
- Defender:
  - Has 2-3 units it can place on the board and move a certain amount of tiles left to right. On the end of the defenders turn, they will "shoot" onto the board in a straight line, eliminating the first attacker's unit in that line if any exist, and can be blocked by impassable tiles.
  - Can roll a dice on their turn for additional benefits, such as forcing the attacker to reveal the position of one unit, getting an extra attack, or an AOE attack on any point of their choosing.
  - Can not see the board beyond their own side. Must manually keep track of impassable tiles, and potential enemy locations.
- Attacker:
  - has 4-5 units that are deployed at the start of the game on the attackers side of the board. Each turn, these units can move a certain amount of tiles forward. There are different types of units that can move faster/further in exchange for being bigger (easier to hit)
  - Can roll a dice on their turn for additional benefits, such as removing an attack for the defender, gaining an additional unit, or placing an impassable tile.
  - Can see the entire board. Must call out when they place impassable tiles, or if their units are "shot" by the defender on the end of their turn.

#### Next Steps
- Design a physical board and design the units, tiles. Refine the rules and perform playtesting.
